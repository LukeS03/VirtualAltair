This is just a personal project, intended to emulate the Intel 8800 CPU. This project is partially based on the "6502 Emulator in C++" Youtube series by Dave Poo.

Rough development roadmap:
1) Emulating the Intel 8080 CPU
2) Creating a class to implement the functionality of the Altair 8800
3) Creating a command-line interface.
4) Creating a GUI interface using SDL2.
