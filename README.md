This project aims to emulate the Intel 8080 CPU architecture and to further use this CPU to simulate an Altair 8800 microcomputer.

Rough development roadmap:
1) Emulating the Intel 8080 CPU
2) Creating a class to implement the functionality of the Altair 8800
3) Creating a command-line interface.
4) Creating a GUI interface using SDL2.
5) Emulating a terminal / teletype.

Further Ideas:
1) Implementing the Z80 CPU (based on the Intel 8080 architecture)
